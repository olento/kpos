# KPOS
is a simple prototype of Retail Point-of-Sale (POS) system. The project was launched to learn a new Javascript
technology stack and try out some new ideas formed during 16 years of developing an existing POS system. It is
also a showcase of my skills as a full stack developer.

This codebase is most likely "the first one to throw away" and I don't recommend anyone using it for any purposes
other than learning.
